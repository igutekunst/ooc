\#\+Objected Oriented C

Documentation that will appear on the main page

Experimenting with \char`\"{}\+Object Oriented C\char`\"{}.

This library is a toy implementation of \char`\"{}objects\char`\"{} in C, with the idea to enable dynamic dispatch and polymorphism of a set of carefully written \char`\"{}classes\char`\"{} .

This library aims to enable\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Less boilerplate code to do common tasks
\item A friendlier standard library
\item A \char`\"{}batteries included\char`\"{} C like environment.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The design of both the A\+PI and internals are inspired by Python, though no attempt has been made to mimic python A\+P\+Is exactly, or interface with Python, though this may be a goal in the future.

This library is completely experimental, and has not been used in any real projects as far as I know.

It\textquotesingle{}s here to share some ideas with friends and the world. My hope is it will be useful one day, at which point I will promote it with more confidence!

\subsection*{lib\+O\+OC}

Example 
\begin{DoxyCode}
#include <libooc/hashmap.h>

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) \{
    struct HashMap * h = new(HashMap);
    /// etc
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Future Work}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add \mbox{\hyperlink{structInt}{Int}}, Float and Big\+Int support
\item Add list
\item Add referencing counting
\item Traits 
\end{DoxyItemize}
